  <h2 class='c005'>WEATHER INDICATIONS<br /> <span class='large'>A Study of the Weather</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the minds of most people a very silly notion prevails about
the weather and the weather man. They have a general impression
that the weather knows no laws—that it is lawless and reckless,
fickle and changeable; that the weather man is a sort of conjurer,
and by some mysterious gift he is able to prophesy things that most
people know nothing about. Nothing could be further from the
truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>After you have carried out the simple experiments described,
and have read this text, whether you have a scientific trend of
mind or not, you will at least learn that the weather is a science,
like electricity, chemistry, or medicine; that its laws are uniform,
constant, and unchanging, and there is really nothing mysterious
about it. The weather man is a scientist and by means of instruments,
which indicate certain things, he comes to definite conclusions.
He is not a prophet; he does not prophesy; he forecasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you are interested in having a Weather Bureau station of
your own, you will find it one of the most interesting things you
ever acquired in your life. You will soon gain a knowledge of a
subject that most people are quite ignorant of, and if you desire
to stand for leadership among your boy friends, it may be achieved
by knowing about those things that to most boys, and in fact
to adults, assume a mysterious and magical aspect.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Weather Bureau station at your home will give you a source
of pleasure, fun, and insight into a science that is intensely interesting,
easy to understand, fascinating and worth while knowing.
The importance of the subject cannot be overestimated. It has
an influence on the whole world; it affects our health; it affects
our comfort; it means success or failure in farming; it has an
immense influence upon transportation. When ready to move
perishable goods, the transporter must have indications of what
the weather is going to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weather observer is the guardian angel of the ships at sea;
some men have doubts as to whether medicine itself has saved
more human lives than the study of the weather and the practice
of weather observing. It is not unusual for those who live along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the coast to see ships hovering into cover long before a storm
approaches, for the wonderful weather bureau system operated
by the United States Government gives warnings and danger
signals all over the country. Statistics show that losses have
been reduced seventy-five to eighty per cent through this system.
The marine warnings are so perfect, so prompt, and so efficient
that for a great many years no long or hard storms have ever
reached any part of the United States without advance warnings
and danger signals being shown beforehand.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a storm is brewing, the Government’s wonderful Weather
Bureau organization watches every atmospheric change with the
greatest care and concern, and takes observations every few hours,
and telegraphs the indications to all places where a warning should
be given. Thereby perishable goods that need protection can be
looked after. When extra hazardous storms and weather changes
of a severe character are indicated, hundreds of thousands of
telegrams are sent out in a comparatively short time, to all parts
of the country, so that interested parties may prepare for such
conditions. One can readily see the great service rendered and the
satisfaction it must be to the shipper and the farmer to know that
his property, which might be destroyed by a bad storm or low temperature,
is being constantly and carefully guarded against danger.
Not only storms and great cold waves have been forecasted, but
floods have been anticipated and warnings given.</p>

<p class='c007'>This brings us to a study of the subject “Weather,” and the
best way to learn about the weather is to first learn about the air.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE AIR</h3>

<p class='c009'>If you were to ask ninety-nine people out of a hundred to take
the stopper out of a bottle, to look into it, and to smell its contents,
and then ask them if, in their opinion, it contained anything,
the invariable answer would be: “It contains nothing.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 1</h3>

<p class='c009'>Take the stopper out of a bottle and endeavor to pour water
into it rapidly and see what happens. (See Fig. <a href='#fig1'>1</a>.) One of the
laws in Physics is that no two bodies can occupy the same space
at the same time. After doing this experiment, you will come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the conclusion that the bottle does contain something, and that
“something” is matter, and that matter is air. There is in the
bottle probably as important a thing as you could possibly conceive
of, because even this earth without its ocean of air would be
a world of desolation; for air sustains life itself, and when agitated,
develops great strength. It may be whirled about into a hurricane
blast and assume such violent proportions that villages will be
swept away, and great waves of water will be raised, upon which
ships can be tossed about like so much chaff. We all know that
air can become so cold that great suffering will be caused, and so
hot that it will make life almost unbearable. We really live in an
ocean of air.</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>THE OCEAN OF AIR</h3>

<p class='c009'>As the fishes live at the bottom of the ocean of water, mankind
lives at the bottom of an “ocean of air.” (See Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>.) No one
is absolutely certain about the depth of this air, but it has been
estimated as low as forty miles and as high as two hundred miles.
Balloons have gone up to a height of nearly nineteen miles (100,320
feet). We do know that the higher we go, the thinner the air
becomes. It is practically impossible
for man to ascend into the
air more than five or six miles,
owing to the fact that the air
above that height is so thin that
there is not enough to breathe.
Naturally, the air at the bottom
is more compact because of the
vast amount of air above. The
air is a great weight lying upon
us—14.7 pounds per square inch
of surface.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>HOW TO PROVE BY EXPERIMENT THAT AIR HAS WEIGHT</h3>

<p class='c009'>The air-globe is a piece of
apparatus for demonstrating
that air has weight. (See Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>.)
First, the air-globe is weighed
and then the air is pumped
into it; its stop-cock is closed
and the globe is reweighed.
It will be found to have gained
in weight. This is conclusive
that air is matter and that it
has weight.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Of great importance to us in the study is the next fact, that air
exerts pressure on everything about us and upon ourselves.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 2</h3>

<p class='c009'>A tumbler is filled with water and a piece of paper placed over
the top of it. The glass is then inverted, holding the hand over
the paper so that none of the water will come out. On taking
the hand away, although the glass of water is inverted, the contents
do not leave the glass. (See Fig. <a href='#fig4'>4</a>.)</p>

<div id='fig5'  class='figleft id002'>
<img src='images/illus008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 5</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p class='c009'>It demonstrates that the air is exerting a pressure from below
on the paper, which is more than enough to support the weight
of the water. The tumbler may be placed in any position and
yet the water will stay in. This air pressure is exerted alike from
all directions, and this pressure,
which is 14.7 pounds to the square
inch, is weighed down by the air
about it and may be likened very
much to ordinary water in that
it exerts pressure in all directions.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 3</h3>

<p class='c009'>Take an ordinary rubber sucker,
such as is used on the end of a dart,
and attach it to a string. Force
this down on a piece of glass.
(See Fig. <a href='#fig5'>5</a>.) The glass can then
by lifted by the pressure of the air
that holds the rubber to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are indebted to a German
experimental philosopher named
Otto Von Guericke for knowledge
of atmospheric pressure. Guericke
is distinguished by his original
discoveries of the properties of
the air. He was born at Magdeburg
in Prussian Saxony, November
20, 1602. He became interested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>at an early age in the politics of his city, and in 1627 was elected
alderman, and in 1646 Mayor of Magdeburg. While serving in
the above capacities, he devoted his leisure to science, especially
on the creation of a vacuum and the action of bodies in a vacuum.
His first experiments were conducted with a pump on a barrel of
water. After drawing off all the water, he still found that air
permeated the wood of the barrel, so he substituted a globe of
copper and pumped out air also. He thus became the inventor of
the air pump and illustrated in a simple but effective way the force
of atmospheric pressure.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 6</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>By placing two hollow hemispheres of copper (see Fig. <a href='#fig6'>6</a>) together,
and exhausting the air, he found that fifteen horses pulling
one way and fifteen pulling the opposite were unable to pull the
hemispheres apart.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>He further demonstrated that in a vacuum all bodies fall equally
fast, that animals cannot exist therein, or, in fact, living matter.
He is also credited with being the inventor of the air balance and
a type of weather cock, called the anemoscope. He was interested
also in astronomy.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 4</h3>

<p class='c009'>This experiment should interest you very much, because it is
going to lead up to the
subject of weather instruments,
and is absolutely
essential that you
understand the fundamental
principles in
order to intelligently
interpret these instruments.
This experiment
will explain one of the
principles of the
barometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take a glass tube
thirty-two inches long
and one-quarter or one-eighth
inch in diameter,
and fill it with mercury,
care being used to get
rid of all the air bubbles.
The mercury
should be poured in
with an eye dropper,
one end of the tube
being sealed, until filled,
and then the finger is
placed over the open
end. (See Fig. <a href='#fig7'>7A</a>). The
tube is inverted and immersed
in a reservoir of
mercury and clamped
to an upright stand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Immediately the mercury
falls to about
thirty inches. (See
Fig. <a href='#fig7'>7B</a>). Ask yourself
what held the mercury
up in the tube. Again
the answer is that the
pressure of the air on
the mercury in the
reservoir causes it to
rise and fall in the
tube, as the pressure
of the air changes.
You will soon learn
what causes these
changes in the pressure
of the air.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 5</h3>

<p class='c009'>Have you ever
asked yourself why it
is that the wind
blows? Why doesn’t
it stand still?</p>

<p class='c007'>Put your hand over
a lamp chimney under
which the lamp is
lighted. You will
soon discover that the heat is rising. Four things in connection
with this are of great importance:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Air has weight.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>When heated, it rises.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>Air expands when heated.
    </dd>
    <dt>4.</dt>
    <dd>Warm air will gather and hold more moisture than cold air.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 6</h3>

<p class='c009'>Cut a piece of stiff cardboard in a spiral shape. Thread a piece
of thread through a pinhole in the center point of the spiral and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>fasten this to a support so that it swings freely in the air. (See
Fig. <a href='#fig8'>8</a>.) Under this put a little alcohol lamp, or put it over a gas
jet or radiator.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHAT HAPPENS</h3>

<p class='c009'>The cardboard will spin around rapidly. Ask yourself what
causes this. It is the force of the hot air rising which caused the
spiral cardboard to turn in such an attractive manner.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 7</h3>

<p class='c009'>When you are in a warm room, find out which air is the hottest,
that in the upper or
that in the lower part
of the room. This
answer you can get by
placing the thermometer
low down in
the room and then
putting it up near the
ceiling. This is another
conclusive proof
that hot air rises.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another experiment
that is quite familiar
to all of us is that of
opening the windows
of a heated room a
few inches top and
bottom, and holding
a lighted match or
smoke paper at the
bottom, when you will
find that it blows the
flame or smoke inward.
Then put it
near the top of the
window and it will be
drawn out. The same
answer is true; the
cold air is rushing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>from below to take the
place of the hot air
rising and going out
at the top. (See Fig.
9.)</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 8</h3>

<p class='c009'>This experiment is
even more important
than the preceding
one, and you should
by all means do it,
for it is going to prove
more conclusively
than anything else
what causes the wind,
and in miniature it
is a real storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Place a little alcohol
lamp on the table,
or a wax candle will
do. Over this place
an ordinary lamp
chimney, lifting it a
short distance off the
table, and it can be
held in position by any little object. (See Fig. <a href='#fig10'>10</a>.) Over the
chimney hold some smoke paper. (Smoke paper is nothing more
than filter paper, or brown wrapping paper of a soft texture.)
From the experiments already visualized to you, you should know
what to expect. You will again see that the heated air is rising;
it has expanded and become light. Now what becomes of the
air that is rising and where does it go? In doing this experiment
be careful not to make any unnatural movements that will change
the current of wind. Stand perfectly still so that the experiment
will be perfect, because you are now producing in miniature a
real storm, or demonstrating the cause of wind.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The next observation—what happens at the bottom of the
chimney? Here you will find the outside air is coming in, the same
as it did in the window experiment. Particularly, notice however,
that the smoke enters underneath the chimney from all directions,
and the smoke paper should be moved away from the glass chimney
to determine the distance at which the smoke flames will still be
drawn into the chimney.</p>

<p class='c007'>You now produced for yourself in miniature a storm and wind.
The air that has been heated rises over a heated area, and cooler
air from all directions around is passing into the space underneath
the chimney and taking the place of the heated air that has gone
up. This experiment illustrates what takes place, except on a
smaller scale, out in the atmosphere when a portion of the earth
becomes heated. If this is clear to you, it will help you to understand
the main principles underlying storms and winds, which will
be given later on.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 9</h3>

<p class='c009'>Equally important is the last part of the experiment, which
consists in lifting the lamp chimney off the table altogether and
continuing with the smoke paper. Note results that you get now.
The smoke will spread out over a large area.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHAT IS THE WEATHER?</h3>

<p class='c009'>By the weather we mean the temperature, the amount of moisture
in the air, the pressure of the air, the movement of the air, and all
the conditions that have to do with the atmosphere, such as heat,
cold, rain, snow, sleet, fog, frost, dew, etc. It has to do with
everything, from calmness and clearness to cloudiness and blizzards.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE EFFECT OF THE SUN</h3>

<p class='c009'>The sun has a great deal to do with the regulation of the weather.
Its heat causes evaporation; it is the rays of the sun that raises
the vapor from the water and brings it into the air; it is the cooling
of this vapor that produces the rain, hail and sleet storms, and its
brilliancy causes a difference in air pressure at times. It is this
difference in air pressure that produces winds, as you will learn
later.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>HUMIDITY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The state of the air with respect to the vapor that it contains
is called its humidity. The humidity is said to be high when the
air is damp, and low when the air is dry. Humidity and moisture
in the air are important factors about the weather. It is lack
of humidity that has more to do with poor health, colds, and
catarrh than anything else. The importance of proper humidity in
houses and buildings cannot be emphasized too greatly. Proper
humidity will save twelve and one-half per cent in the cost of
heating. The great majority of people are under the impression
that colds are caused by sudden change in temperature, but the
most colds are actually caused by stuffy, hot rooms. The reason
that some people complain that 70° is not hot enough is because
the humidity is too low, but if the moisture is brought into the air
at a proper degree, the humidity is maintained. You will find that
68° will be a proper temperature to maintain in a room. The reason
for this is that the air in the room is dry and the heat actually goes
through it. In other words, it does not warm it; moist air stops
radiation. Consequently, the result is that it warms it. In other
words, moisture is nothing more than clothing, and this accounts
for the fact that in a hot room, where there is no moisture, we heat
our rooms beyond the degree that is necessary in order to feel
any reasonable amount of comfort. Dry air allows too much radiation
from the body and too rapid evaporation, which makes
us cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following experiment illustrates the above statement.
Place a few drops of water on a smooth surface, such as a table top
or ordinary board, and over this a watch glass, containing a small
quantity of ether. In order to hasten evaporation, blow a current
of air across it, and it will be found that the glass will be frozen
to the board. This is caused by the evaporation of the ether, which
uses up heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>You know a great many times when you go out into the wind
how cold it feels, and yet if the wind would actually stop, you
would think it warm. It is the wind that causes the rapid evaporation
and makes the surface of the skin feel cold. As it is true
that the moisture in the air acts as a blanket to us in our homes,
it is likewise as true that the vapor in its natural form outside of
the house acts as a blanket for the earth. Do you realize that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>without this blanket we would burn up in the summer and freeze
to death in the winter?</p>

<h3 class='c008'>FOGS</h3>

<p class='c009'>Water vapor in the air is transparent, but when this water vapor
becomes cooled, a portion of it becomes precipitated, which is
no more or less than drops of water that are extremely small, but
yet large enough to become transparent, and the atmosphere in
this state is called fog. In reality, fogs are nothing more than
clouds near the surface of the earth. When the ground is at a
higher temperature than the air, it produces fogs. They are also
produced when a current of moist air and a current of hot air pass
over a body of water at a lower temperature. Consequently, you
can easily see that fog will never form when it is dry.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>HAIL</h3>

<p class='c009'>After rain drops have been formed and they freeze in their
passage through the air, they then become hailstones.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SNOW</h3>

<p class='c009'>When condensation of vapor in the air takes place at a temperature
below 32° F., a deposit is made in a solid condition, either in
the form of snow or hail. Snow is made up of crystals, most of which
have great beauty. Everyone should observe either by the naked
eye or by a magnifying glass the little crystals caught before they
are broken. When you see extremely large snowflakes in the
sky, you can be sure the temperature is very near freezing, for at
this point the flakes are more or less damp and the snow is heavy
and wet. Now if there is a slight wind, the crystals become broken
and separate flakes unite to form large masses of snow. Generally
speaking, ten inches of snow makes one inch of rain.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>DEW</h3>

<p class='c009'>If the temperature of the ground falls below the dew point of
the air, the air deposits on the cooler surface moisture in the form
of small drops of water, which we call dew drops. Where the
temperature of the ground becomes cooler than the air above it,
a rapid cooling by radiation on a clear night has taken place; and
if the dew point or frost point has been reached by the ground, the
air just above the point is several degrees warmer.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>FROST</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When the moisture in the air that is in contact with the earth is
condensed above the freezing point, dew is formed. When below
the freezing point, frost is formed or deposited on the earth. It is
readily understood from this that the surface on which the frost is
deposited is at a freezing temperature, while the air above it may
not be freezing. Naturally, you can expect frost when the temperature
falls to a point 8° or 10° above the freezing point. Clear,
calm nights are favorable for frost, because the absence of clouds
helps radiation, that is, it draws heat away from the earth. If
there are clouds, it prevents this radiation.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THUNDER AND LIGHTNING</h3>

<p class='c009'>Free electricity is always in the air. During clear weather it is
generally positive; during cloudy weather it is negative. This
electricity is carried in the air by the moisture. As dry air is a
non-conductor of electricity, in fair weather the electrified particles
of air are insulated and therefore acquire very little intensity. The
clouds having been formed and being filled with moisture, form an
excellent conductor of electricity, which acquires considerable
intensity. It is a well-known physical law that two bodies having
opposite electricities attract each other, and those having like
charges repel each other. From this, two clouds having opposite
charges rush together and produce the phenomena, called lightning,
which is accompanied by an explosion called thunder. Often we
see several flashes of lightning and then hear several thunder crashes,
which is caused by only one section of a cloud discharging its
electricity at a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a cloud attracts the opposite charge of electricity from the
surface of the earth beneath it by inductive influence, often we see
a discharge of electricity from the cloud to the earth, the charge
usually being received by such objects as hills, trees, church spires,
high buildings, etc. Bodies containing large quantities of moisture
are susceptible to strokes of lightning, as the moisture causes them
to become good conductors of electricity. Also trees on the outer
edge of a forest are more liable to be struck than those farther in.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several forms of lightning, such as zigzag, ball, sheet,
and heat lightning.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Zigzag lightning, as the name implies, follows an irregular course,
producing a long zigzag line of light, sometimes ten miles in length,
and is caused by the air producing a field of resistance to the
path of electricity, causing it to seek a path of less resistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ball lightning appears like a large ball of fire, usually accompanied
by a terrific explosion. This is the result of the bodies
being charged with electricity of great intensity, and travels in a
straight path, as it has enough strength to oppose any resistance
placed in its path.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heat lightning is usually seen on warm evenings, especially
during the summer, and very often unaccompanied by thunder,
due to the great distance of the lightning clouds from where we are
located, thus diminishing the intensity of the thunder. The electricity
of the clouds escape in flashes so feeble as to produce no
audible sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sheet lightning is a diffused glare of light sometimes illuminating
only the edges of a cloud, and again spreading over its entire
surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ordinary flashes of lightning last but the minutest part of a
second.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder is the re-entrance of air into an empty space. The vacuum
is created by the lightning in its passage through the air.
The violence of thunder varies according to the intensity of the
electrical flashes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Because of the fact that light is transmitted almost instantaneously,
while sound travels at a speed of eleven hundred feet per
second, the sound will not reach the ear for some few seconds
after the flash of lightning. Average space of time between a flash
and a report is about twelve seconds. The longest interval is seventy-two
seconds and the shortest one second. Prolonged peals
of thunder are, in some cases, due to the effect of echoes. These
peals are especially noticeable in mountainous countries. The
echoes are also produced by the reflection of sound from the clouds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder storms are distributed over certain sections of the
globe, occurring most frequently in the equatorial regions and diminishing
as we approach the polar regions. Within the tropics, where
there are trade winds, thunder storms are rare. Thunder storms are
common in warm climates because evaporation supplies electricity in
great abundance, and thus precipitation of the air is brought about.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>TORNADOES</h3>

<p class='c009'>Tornadoes are caused by the
air becoming abnormally heated
over certain areas. Likewise,
caused by a difference in
pressure. Tornadoes are local
whirlwinds of great energy,
generally formed within thunder
storms. They are most easily
distinguished by a funnel-shaped
cloud that hangs from the bottom
of the larger thunder cloud
mass above it. The funnel is
formed around a violent ascending
mass of whirling winds;
its diameter sometimes reaching
several hundred feet, being larger above than below, the winds themselves
covering a greater space.</p>

<div id='fig12'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus019b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 12</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The whirling funnel advances generally to the east or northeast
at a rate of twenty to forty miles an hour, accompanied by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>deafening noise, destroying everything in its path. The path is
usually less than a quarter of a mile in width.</p>

<p class='c007'>The winds in the vortex (the apparent cavity or vacuum formed
in the center of the whirling winds) of the tornado attain an incredible
violence, and due to this fact houses are shattered, trees uprooted,
and human lives lost, besides other devastation of property
and animal life. It is, therefore, the vorticular whirl that causes
the destruction produced by tornadoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tornadoes are more frequent in the southern states than anywhere
else in the country, and occur in the warmer months.</p>

<p class='c007'>The velocity of the whirling winds in a tornado increase towards
the center, and it is because of this that the point of danger is only
a small distance from the funnel cloud. The direction of the whirling
motion is from right to left. From the appearance of the
funnel formed in a tornado, it looks as though the currents were
descending from the cloud to the earth, when in reality the currents
are ascending. The ascending current draws on the warm and
moist air near the surface of the earth for its supply, and this
inrush of air in a spiral form into the low pressure core made by the
higher whirl constitutes the destructive blast of the tornado.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tornadoes approach rapidly, and it is therefore almost impossible
for those who happen to be in their path to escape their
violence.</p>

<p class='c007'>A tornado at sea is termed a water spout.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>RAINFALL</h3>

<p class='c009'>You will recall a preceding statement that evaporated humidity
turns into water when it becomes cool below a certain point.
(See page <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>, Effect of the Sun.) A given amount of air will hold
a certain amount of moisture. For example, let us assume that a
cubic foot of air (see Fig. <a href='#fig11'>11</a>) is saturated, that is, it is holding all
the water it will retain. Now if this cubic foot of air is cooled, it
will contract, and as a result there will not be enough room to
hold both the air and moisture, so the excess moisture will leak out.
(See Fig. <a href='#fig12'>12</a>.) The result of this reduction in temperature causes
precipitation, simply because the air cannot sustain the water
that is in it. Therefor, at any time when moisture in the air has
reached the point of saturation and a chilling takes place, due to
the air becoming cold, rain follows. This may happen as a result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of air rising into higher places or cooler levels, or through its contact
with cooler surfaces.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHY WE GET SUCH HEAVY RAINFALLS SOMETIMES AROUND MOUNTAINS</h3>

<p class='c009'>The air becomes thoroughly saturated. When air is comparatively
warm, it will expand, and this air, which is heavily saturated
is brought up by breezes onto the mountain range, which is cold,
causing the air to lose its heat and contract and really force the
water out of the air. The same principle applies to sea breezes
bringing rain.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WINDS</h3>

<p class='c009'>Winds are caused as a result of differences in temperature between
the various layers of the atmosphere. A certain amount of air
becomes heated and rises, and as explained before, expands. As
the air expands, it becomes lighter, and because it is light it goes
upward toward higher regions. It also flows from hot to cold
countries. A good illustration of this is the sea breezes. If you
have lived around the seashore in the summer time, you will have
observed that during the hot part of the day the winds generally
blow from the sea toward the land. At night the direction of the
wind is reversed, that is, it blows from the land to the sea. Why?
Because the land during the day retains its heat, while the water
diffuses it. What is the result? The air on the land expands,
becomes light. The air over the water being cool, it does not
expand, and the result is that it presses toward the land. At
night the land loses its heat more rapidly than the water, so that
it is not long before the land is cooler than the water, and when
this happens, the air over the land, which has become cooler,
presses seaward.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>KINDS OF WINDS</h3>

<p class='c009'><strong>Mountain Breezes</strong>: Caused by the heating and cooling of the
hills and valleys.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Avalanche Winds</strong>: Winds that are in front of a landslide, caused
by the movement of the snow forcing the air in front of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the roof of the factory is a weather vane (Fig. <a href='#fig34'>34</a>) twenty
feet high, which is connected electrically with a register in our
weather office. The register is of the quadruple type (Fig. <a href='#fig45'>45</a>),
and is capable of recording wind direction, wind velocity, rainfall,
and sunshine on the same form or sheet. Thus, we know the wind
direction and can deduce certain things relating to the weather.
Mounted on the wind vane support is an anemometer (Fig. <a href='#fig36'>36</a>),
an instrument for measuring the velocity of the wind. A rain
gauge (Fig. <a href='#fig49'>49</a>) on the roof catches the precipitation, and for every

its contents into a receiver and a record is made on the form in
the quadruple register.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same pen that records the rainfall also records the number

<h3 class='c008'>CLOUDS</h3>

<p class='c009'>The numberless kinds of clouds makes it quite difficult to
describe and arrange them or illustrate them in any manner that
makes it easy to recognize them. Although some may be recognized
from description and with a fair amount of observation, you
will be able to classify them in their proper place. For instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the thunder clouds most anyone recognizes without any experience
whatever.</p>

<div id='fig28'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus030.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 28</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There are really four simple cloud formations and three compound
formations:</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>1. The Cirrus Cloud.</strong> (Fig. <a href='#fig24'>24</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cirrus cloud is always seen high in the sky and at a great
elevation. Its formation is fibrous and it is particularly characterized
for its many varieties of shapes. It also has a marked
delicacy of substance and it is pure white.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>2. The Cumulus Cloud.</strong> (Fig. <a href='#fig25'>25</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cumulus cloud is of moderately low elevation. It is a typical
cloud of a summer day. It may be recognized by little heaps or
bushes rising from a horizontal base. In summer-time we are all
familiar with the cumulus clouds rising with the currents of air in
huge masses. They form one of the most accurate indications of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>fair weather when you see them gradually dissolving. Sometimes
these clouds become very large, and, while the texture is generally
of a woolly white, naturally, when they assume such large sizes,
they gradually change in color to a darkish tint.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>3. The Stratus Cloud.</strong> (Fig. <a href='#fig26'>26</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the opposite of the Cirrus cloud, because it hangs the
lowest of all, in gray masses or sheets, with a poorly-defined outline.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>4. The Nimbus Cloud.</strong> (Fig. <a href='#fig27'>27</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Any cloud can be classed as a nimbus cloud from which rain or
snow is falling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the Compound Clouds we have:</p>

<div id='fig29'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 29</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>1. The Cirro-Cumulus Cloud (Fig. <a href='#fig28'>28</a>), which has all the characteristics
of both the Cirrus and the Cumulus. The most characteristic
form of this cloud, and the one most commonly known, is
when these clouds form small round masses, which appear to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>cirrus bands broken up and curled up. This is what people call
the “mackerel” sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The Cirro-Stratus Cloud (Fig. <a href='#fig29'>29</a>), which is known when
the clouds arrange themselves in thin horizontal layers at a great
elevation.</p>

<div id='fig30'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus032.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 30</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>3. The Cumulo-Stratus (Fig. <a href='#fig30'>30</a>) is the cumulus and the stratus
blended together. Their most remarkable form is in connection
with approaching thunder storms, and are often called thunder
heads. They rapidly change their outline and present a beautiful
spectacle in the sky at times.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cirrus, Cirro-Cumulus and Cirro-Stratus are known as the
upper clouds and the others are known as the lower.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES</h3>

<p class='c009'>Disturbances of the atmosphere are classified as follows: Cyclonic,
or low area storms, or anti-cyclonic, or high area storms.</p>

<div id='fig31'  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
<img src='images/illus033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 31</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The word “cyclone” to most people immediately means a terrific
storm, whereas in weather observing the  cyclonic storm is not
really a cyclone or hurricane at all. It is a storm with an atmospheric
pressure below average. Particularly important is the wind
that blows about this area, which is always spirally inward, due
to the rotation of the earth on its axis. This is probably why it is
given the name of cyclonic storm, for it bears one of the important
characteristics of a real cyclone. As the wind is deflected and
moves into the storm center, it turns to the right and in the form
of a whirlwind, spirally, moves around the storm center. (See
Fig 31.) It is this whirling process that has given it the name,
cyclonic storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the air rises over the point of low storm area, or, in other words,
the area of low pressure, and travels into the atmosphere, it is
not permitted to rise to any great height, because it is always
acted upon by the force of gravity and is being pulled back to earth
again. We assume that because of this fact, this rising air which
has been pulled back to the earth again piles up in certain places,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>causing the barometer
to rise. Such a
center as this is
known as a high barometric
center or the
anti-cyclonic area.
Here the circulation
of the air is exactly
opposite to that of
the cyclonic area.</p>

<div id='fig32'  class='figleft id002'>
<img src='images/illus034.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 32</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We are all more or
less acquainted with
these anti-cyclonic
storms, because in
winter these great
masses of air rise up
from the warm areas,
pile up, and form high
pressure areas over
the mountains of
Canada, and soon
this high pressure
works down upon us
as blizzards and cold
waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have described
quite minutely the
movement of the
wind about these
points of high pressure and low pressure and have shown you the
map and have illustrated the high pressure and low pressure areas,
but there is still another feature that is of great importance to
us, and that is the movement of the storms and the fact that
storms have a progressive movement from west to east.</p>

<p class='c007'>These storms move more rapidly in the United States than elsewhere,
and are more rapid in their movement in winter than in
summer. Their speed is almost one half again as great. The
average velocity of the low area storm in the United States is
about twenty-five miles an hour in June, July, August, and September,
and from October on they continue to increase.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>LOW PRESSURE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We can summarize low pressure storms generally in the following
manner: They have a wind circulation inward and upward and
are elliptical in form. Their velocity varies from six hundred to
nine hundred miles per day, moving in the same general direction.
They are characterized in their eastern quadrants by cloudy weather,
southerly and easterly winds, precipitation, temperature oppressive
in summer and abnormally high in winter, falling barometer,
increasing humidity and followed by clear weather, rising barometer,
decreasing humidity and falling temperature in the western
quadrants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buys Ballot’s law of winds is, that in the Northern Hemisphere
if one stands with his back to the wind, the low barometric
pressure will be invariably to the left hand; in the Southern
Hemisphere the lowest pressure is always to the right. This law
explains one of the characteristics of low pressure storms.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>AREAS OF HIGH PRESSURE</h3>

<p class='c009'>In speaking of low pressure storms we called them storm centers,
because nearly always they are of sufficient intensity to bear that
name, but in high pressure areas we do not speak of them as storm
centers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Buys Ballot’s law applies to anti-cyclonic as well as cyclonic
storms, that is, when one’s back is to the wind, the lowest barometric
pressure is at the left and the highest at the right. This is
probably understood by saying that in the cyclonic storms, the
winds blow inward, contrary to the hands of a watch, and in the
anti-cyclonic they blow outward, that is, in the same direction to
the direction of the hands of the watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the United States, the cyclonic storms are not as frequent as
low pressure storms, and it is safe to say that probably not more
than one-third of the entire anti-cyclonic areas can be classed as
storm areas.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHY AIR RISES</h3>

<p class='c009'>Another very interesting experiment is to secure a long-stemmed
glass bulb (see Fig. <a href='#fig32'>32</a>). Arrange this apparatus as illustrated,
with the stem of the bulb immersed in the water. The glass bulb
condenses the air. When you first put it into the water nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>happens, but as soon as you apply heat the air bubbles come out
of the end of the tube. This means that the air in the tube has
expanded and part of it has come out through the stem of the
tube and the remainder is lighter. It is well to remember, when
air is heated it expands and becomes lighter. This fact is extremely
important to remember, because it has a great deal to do with the
important instrument, the barometer, which is used to measure
the pressure of the atmosphere and is an important element in the
question of humidity, as you will learn later. By this time you
no doubt have learned that:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Air has weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Heated air expands, becomes lighter, and exerts less pressure.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Cold air comes from the side to take the place of hot air that
rises.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the rays of the sun heat an area of the earth, the air over
such a place expands and becomes lighter, naturally rising, and
the result of this is that the winds are produced by cool air moving
in to take the place of the heated air. This cool air moves in from
all directions. When such a thing happens at any point on the
earth’s surface, it is known as a storm center, an area of low pressure.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHAT IS A CYCLONIC STORM?</h3>

<p class='c009'>Because of the rotation of the earth on its axis, a force arises
which tends to deflect to the right all motions in the northern
hemisphere, and to the left all motions in the southern hemisphere.
The winds flowing toward the storm center are turned to the right
or left and move in a spiral around the storm center. This system
of whirling winds around a central region of low pressure produce
what is termed a cyclonic storm. Storms have a tendency to move
in an easterly or northeasterly direction, and at a rate of from five
hundred to seven hundred miles a day. Cyclonic storms, although
we look upon them as being very severe, are very often mild and
not of an intensive character.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHICH WAY DOES THE WIND BLOW AFTER A STORM?</h3>

<p class='c009'>From the descriptions and experiments preceding, which illustrate
the development of storms, reference was made only to the
winds blowing in toward the storm center. Naturally the question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>comes to your mind: What happens to them after the cold air has
taken the place of the warm air? They change to other directions
when the storm has passed away. It is because of this fact that we
look for a change in weather conditions when the wind changes—a
very important sign that you will be interested in later on.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well to mention here a thing that is going to be very important
to us when we study the barometer, that is, the pressure
of the atmosphere. Should the pressure of the air, which is normally
at sea level 14.7 pounds to the square inch, change, that is, become
lighter, it would not exert so much pressure on the column of
mercury in the tube of the barometer and the mercury would drop
in the tube. (See Fig. <a href='#fig7'>7</a>.) On the other hand, if the weight of
the air was increased, that is, if it became heavier, it would force
the mercury to rise in the tube. This should be quite clear to you,
because it is the lightness and heaviness of the air that is going to
interest us more particularly than any other part of the subject
when we get into the study of the atmospheric changes, what
causes them, and the indications that lead up to our conclusions.
In order that this principle is absolutely clear to you, you should
perform Experiment 4, or if you have not facilities for doing it,
it is well to see it performed in any physics laboratory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately you ask yourself: If air has such a tremendous
pressure as 14.7 pounds to the square inch, why is it that a weight
of air amounting to thirty-five thousand pounds bearing down
on the average individual does not cave the body in? Simply because
air penetrates the body so easily that it exerts as much
pressure on the inside as on the outside, and thereby equalizes
itself. For instance, if you go down into a subway or a caisson
(a water-tight box or chamber within which submarine construction
is carried on under great air pressure to keep out the water), where
the pressure is sometimes greater than it is outside, have you
noticed the effect this pressure exerts on the ear drums? As it
becomes greater, you may equalize it by swallowing, which allows
the air to get back of the ear drums through the Eustachian tubes,
which lead from the mouth to the inner ear.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>MOISTURE</h3>

<p class='c009'>Water vapor is always present in the air.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 10</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Expose a piece of dry potash to the air. You will soon discover
that the potash will dissolve. It has taken up water from the air.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENT NO. 11</h3>

<p class='c009'>Put a piece of ice in a pitcher of water and allow it to stand in
a warm room. You will soon notice that little beads of perspiration
collect on the outside of the pitcher. This moisture is air being
condensed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water vapor is part of the atmosphere. Some of it is always
present in the air. The amount of vapor that the air can hold
depends upon the temperature. When the temperature is warm,
the air will hold more water. For instance, at 100° F. a cubic
foot of air will hold 19.79 grains of vapor; at 80° F., 10.95 grains;
at 50° F., 4.09 grains, and 32° F., 2.17 grains. At 32° F. is the
freezing point on the Fahrenheit scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Air containing as much water vapor as it can hold is saturated.
If the air is suddenly cooled down, that is, if the temperature falls
when the air is saturated, air molecules are contracted, and it must
give up the water, which produces rain. The ocean and the Great
Lakes are the source from which the air gets its water. It rises
into the air in the form of vapor, that is, vapor rising from the
surface of the water, and the wind distributes it over the land.
Condensation turns it into clouds, and when it is over-saturated,
or rather, when the temperature drops and the air is unable to
retain any more water, then it forms into drops of water and falls
as rain. When the clouds get into the air, below the freezing point
of the water, the drops of water are changed into ice crystals or
snow flakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the ice crystals are just at the point of melting into water,
due to the rise in temperature, the snowflakes lose their form and
the result is sleet.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>HOW CAN WE USE THESE FACTS?</h3>

<p class='c009'>So far we have described, in a general way, certain facts about
the elements of the air, such as temperature, pressure, humidity,
precipitation, evaporation, clouds, winds, etc., and these facts of
the elements enter into a very interesting phase of weather observation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>which we will designate as prophesying without instruments
or forecasting by physical science. When we come to the more
interesting and scientific part of weather observation, we will drop
the word “prophecy,” because the instruments that are used to
measure these elements are going to indicate certain things to
us that will lead you to more definite conclusions. Hence, the
following observations are what have given an opportunity to the
weather prophet or to those people who have been credited with
some mysterious power to prophesy what the weather is going to
be. They are not definite or conclusive, and they cannot always
be depended upon, but they certainly are significant and interesting,
and a description of weather would not be complete without
a list in chronological order of a series of phenomena or physical
signs of this character that have lead certain men to gain quite a
reputation for prophesying what the weather is going to be.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>APPEARANCES</h3>

<p class='c009'>Various appearances that come in the sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>For instance, a good example is in the case of the thunder storm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>which can be determined at least a few hours in advance, by the
movement of the clouds and the forms they take. In every
locality there is a direction that clouds take that forecasts bad
weather, and there is a direction that clouds take that forecasts fair
weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>When you see a halo about the top of a mountain, you know
that bad weather is expected. The same is true when a halo
appears about the moon. This indicates rain, or if the lower clouds
break up and the upper clouds, or a second light covering of clouds,
are seen above the lower ones, it speaks for continued bad weather.
In some localities if rainy weather is continuing for some time,
and a certain change in wind sets in, it will indicate that good
weather is coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>These observations will be readily understood as being adapted
for certain localities and are not general. It is always necessary
that the observer adapt himself to these localities and study them,
so that he can make prophecies accordingly. It should be borne
in mind that these prophecies are only possible from one day to
another.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHAT THE CLOUDS INDICATE</h3>

<p class='c009'>When high clouds are seen crossing the sun or the moon in a
different direction from the lower clouds, this indicates change of
wind toward the direction of the higher clouds. When you see
hard-edged clouds, look for wind. When you see delicate soft clouds,
look for fine weather and probably moderate breeze or high breeze.
When you see gloomy dark clouds in a blue sky, look for slight
winds. When you see a bright blue sky through fine clouds that
are soft and delicate, this indicates fine weather. When you see
soft-looking clouds, you can expect less wind, but probably rain.
But when the clouds become hard and ragged, tufted and rolling
in appearance, stronger winds are coming. When you see small
clouds that are inky looking, look for rain. When you see light
clouds traveling across heavy hard masses of clouds, this indicates
both wind and rain, but if the light scud clouds are alone,
you may expect wind only. Misty clouds forming or hanging over
the peaks of hills indicate both wind and rain. If during a rainy
spell they ascend or disperse the weather is pretty certain to clear
up. If there has been fine weather and you begin to see light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>streaks in the sky which are distant clouds, and they continue to
increase and grow into cloudiness, this indicates rain.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SUNSET AS AN INDICATION</h3>

<p class='c009'>When the sun is setting and the sky in the west presents a color
of whitish yellow or radiates out at a great height, rain can be
looked for during the next night or day. Gaudy colors where
clouds are definitely outlined indicate probably wind and rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before setting, if the sun looks diffused and the color is a brilliant
white, this forecasts storms. When the sun sets in a slightly
purple sky and the color at the zenith is a bright blue, this indicates
fine weather. A red sunset generally indicates good weather,
whereas a ruddy or misty sunset indicates bad weather.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHAT THE SKY INDICATES</h3>

<p class='c009'>When you see a dark, dismal sky, look for rain. A sky with a
greenish hue, described as a sickly-looking sky, is an indication
of both rain and wind. A sailor’s sky, which is red in the morning,
means either wind or rain, and it makes no difference if the sky is
cloudy or clear, if at sunset it is rosy, it indicates fine weather.
A gray sky in the morning indicates fine weather. When daylight
is first seen above a bank of clouds, look for a good stiff wind.
Wind is indicated if we have a bright yellow sky in the morning,
and rain is indicated if the sky takes on a pale yellow hue. If
the sky turns bright yellow late in the afternoon, it generally indicates
that rain is near at hand. Unusual colorations, particularly
of deep intense color, indicate wind or rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following appearances indicate a change in the weather:
When the atmosphere is clear and crystalline and the stars appear
extremely bright; when the background of the horizon seems to
be pinned up against the foreground; when the clouds form into
delicate white film-like mist way up overhead. (Fig. <a href='#fig33'>33</a>.)</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHAT FOG AND DEW INDICATE</h3>

<p class='c009'>Locality has considerable to do with what the fog indicates.
As a rule, where you have fog, there is not much wind, and as a
result it does not indicate stormy weather, unless the fog becomes
heavy with overhanging sky, then it is apt to turn into rain, but a
heavy fog with a light sky indicates fine weather. A fog in the
morning generally indicates a fair day. A rising fog is a good indication
for fair weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dew is a pretty good sign of fine weather. When you can see
and hear with remarkable clearness, and everything is calm and
still, it is a pretty infallible sign that cold weather is due.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost may be looked for on clear, calm, cloudless nights, when
the ground is apt to be cooler than the air.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>INDICATIONS FROM CIRRUS CLOUDS</h3>

<p class='c009'>When these clouds suddenly appear in the sky on a clear summer
day, they indicate wet weather. Especially if the weather ends turn
upward, which means that the clouds are coming down. When
moisture in the form of little drops cling to vegetation, it is a
pretty good indication that there is apt to be more rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the sky assumes the appearance of a gray mass and the
sun is observed shining through, it is a pretty good indication
that it will rain before night.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>When overhead clouds are thick and grayish and the lower
surface of them is lumpy, this is an indication of rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whirlwinds of dust are also indications of rain.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE MOON</h3>

<p class='c009'>The rings that we see formed about the moon are caused by the
delicate white clouds through which the moon is shining.</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>THE RAINBOW</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The morning rainbow indicates that a shower is in the west,
but if the rainbow is in the east it indicates that the shower has
passed over.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>BIRDS AND STORMS</h3>

<p class='c009'>There are certain actions of birds that indicate many things
pertaining to the weather that are interesting. It is probable
that their ability to fly into the air gives them a view of the horizon,
that by instinct they have been able to determine the atmospheric
changes. For instance, it is well known that if birds of long flight
remain at their base, it generally foretells a storm. The sudden
silence of birds has been referred to a great many times preceding
a storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Barnyard fowls do many peculiar things that foretell certain
weather conditions. The crow flies low and in great circles, cawing
loudly, before approaching rain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the house fly is a pretty good barometer. Generally
before a storm they seem to light on everything, particularly
persons, and we call them “sticky.” Generally at these times
they congregate in swarms. Most everyone is familiar with the
gnat. They are one of the few insects that gives us indications
and good signs, and when you see them forming in groups and
moving along in front of you, you may expect fair weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many other interesting facts and fairy tales about
indications by animals and insects, but there is nothing scientific
about them. It has been demonstrated that there is nothing
conclusive to be drawn from such signs, so we will not attempt
to waste pages of this book reiterating these fables.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain actions of insects and animals give indications and enable
the weather prophet to prophesy. The spider is a good example
of an insect prophet, and if you will observe him carefully, you will
find that when stormy weather is going to come on he shortens
his webs, and if he anticipates a long, hard storm, he not only
shortens the strings that hold up the web, but he strengthens them
as well, and vice-versa, when he anticipates fine weather, he lengthens
his strands of the web. When you see the spider cease his
activities and he hangs pretty close to his home, which is the center
of the web, you will know that rain is approaching. On the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>hand, if he continues to spread about during a storm, you can be
pretty certain that it is not going to be of very long duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The frog is a good example of an animal prophet. There is a
green frog which has been studied in Germany, which will come
out of the water when rainy weather or cold is approaching. Some
observers have placed these frogs in a glass jar with a landing
provided so that he can come out of the water when he wants to,
and he is always observed high and dry above the water several
hours in advance of a storm.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS<br /> <span class='large'>Forecasting Weather by Means of Instruments</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The first part of this book may not appeal to you, if you are of
a scientific trend of mind, but it is quite essential that you possess
a knowledge of the fundamentals treated in the earlier pages in
order to thoroughly understand the weather instruments we will
now describe. These instruments are the scientific means of forecasting
what the weather is going to be. They definitely indicate
certain things, and from these indications you are going to be
able to draw conclusions and become a scientist or meteorologist.
The success that you attain will depend upon the accuracy of the
instruments and the care you use in reading them. You will be
able to rig up a Weather Bureau of your own, and the use of these
instruments will interest anyone in a study of the weather.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE WEATHER VANE</h3>

<p class='c009'>To make a forecast, it is essential from what we have already
written, to know the direction of the wind, and to determine the
direction we must have a weather vane. It is real important that
the vane should be sensitive to the slightest movement of the wind
and give actual wind directions. At the same time it must possess
the property of steadiness, so that when it is set up it will be rigid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. <a href='#fig34'>34</a> shows the standard weather vane used at all United
States Weather Bureau Stations and Fig. <a href='#fig35'>35</a> shows the Gilbert
Weather Vane.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. <a href='#fig35'>35</a>. The Gilbert weather vane consists of a metal arrow
pointer and a metal rod eight inches long and five thirty-seconds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of an inch in diameter. The rod is fastened by means of a few
staples to the side of a pole, or whatever is to be used as a support
for the vane. About three inches from the top of the rod is a collar
with set screw, which is tightened, and the vane itself is then placed
on the rod, the rod passing through the small angles A and B, between
the sides of the vane. It will be found that the vane will
swing freely on this support, and by constructing two crosspieces
with letters N, S, E, and W at each end of the pieces, of course
having N pointing directly north, the vane will swing around and
show the direction of the wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The standard United States Weather Bureau type hardly needs
explanation, as the illustration clearly shows all parts. It is the
old, reliable, standard iron, combined wind vane and anemometer
support complete, twenty feet high; iron contact box near base,
improved roller bearings for six-foot vane; latter, with electrical
contacts shown enlarged at the right. The vane is fastened securely
to the roof of the building and held in a perfectly vertical position.</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>THE ANEMOMETER. Fig. <a href='#fig36'>36</a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is essential to know the velocity of the wind. This is determined
by means of an instrument called the anemometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. <a href='#fig36'>36</a>. The Standard U. S. Weather Bureau Station Anemometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the well-known standard Robinson Anemometer, now
in universal use throughout the world for the registration of wind
velocity, but of the latest improved construction. It records electrically
the miles or kilometers, etc., of wind movements on a
register. The standard pattern as furnished to Weather Bureau
stations is made of brass, highly polished and finished, aluminum
(or copper reinforced) cups, steel spindle with hard steel bearings,
a ten-mile or kilometer indicator, electrical contacts, etc.</p>

<div id='fig38'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 38</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The four hollow hemispherical cups are mounted upon cross-arms
at right angles to each other, with the open sections vertical
and facing the same way around the circumference. The cross-arms
are on a vertical axis, which has at its lower end an endless
screw. This axis is supported so as to turn with as little friction
as possible. The endless screw is in gear with a wheel which moves
two dials registering the number of revolutions of the cups. The
mechanisms are mounted in a suitable metal case with glass front,
as shown in the illustration, well protected from the weather, the
whole being designed for outdoor use.</p>

<div id='fig39'  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The center of the cups moves with a velocity about one-third
that of the wind which puts them in motion. The cups are four
inches in diameter. The distance from center of cup to center of
rotation or axis is 6.72 inches. Assuming that the wind-travel is
exactly three times that of the center of the cup, the dials are
marked to register miles of wind travel, five hundred revolutions
of the cups corresponding to a mile.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ratio of wind-travel to travel of cup is in reality variable,
depending on the velocity of the wind. It is less for high than low
velocities. It varies also with the dimensions of the instrument,
being different for every different length of arm and diameter of
cup.</p>

<p class='c007'>On account of the great interference offered by buildings and other
obstructions to the free movement of the wind, its velocity is much
less in the vicinity of these obstructions than beyond; therefore,
in selecting the location for an anemometer, preference should be
given to the more elevated points in the vicinity of the station,
and some rigid support should be used to raise the instrument as
far as practicable above the immediate influence of the office
building itself. The support must be set up so that the anemometer
on top or on the cross-arm is as nearly vertical as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The illustration shows clearly the appearance of an approved
Weather Bureau pattern combined support for wind instruments,
similar to the one installed at our plant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. <a href='#fig37'>37</a>. The Gilbert Anemometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gilbert Anemometer consists of a case containing
a spindle passing through a worm gear, which turns a
toothed gear. This gear in its rotary motion makes a
contact with a brass brush, which is connected electrically
with a flashlight. The cross-arms, with cups
attached, is placed on the spindle, and as the wind blows,
it revolves the cups, causing the contact. The velocity of
the wind is determined by counting the flashes for fifteen
seconds, thus giving you the number of miles per hour.
For instance, if light flashes eight times in fifteen seconds,
this signifies that the wind is blowing eight miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. <a href='#fig38'>38</a>. How to Connect the Gilbert Anemometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>By referring to the diagram, you will see that one
wire which should be the annunciator wire, or even a
small electric light wire, is connected from the wire at
the anemometer case directly to one side of the lamp
socket. Another piece of the same size wire connects
the other side of the lamp socket to one terminal of
your switch. The second terminal of the switch should
be connected to an outer post of one dry battery. The
inner post of this same dry battery should be connected
to the outer post of the second dry battery. Complete
the circuit by connecting the inner post of the second
dry battery to any one of the screws at the bottom
of the anemometer case. The lamp used should be a
small flashlight battery lamp for use on two and a half
to three volts. Be sure in making the connections that
the ends of your wire are scraped free from insulation
and dirt. This can be done by cutting off the insulation
with a knife and then rubbing the copper wire
bright by a piece of sandpaper or emery cloth, or even
a file. The switch should be left open when you are not
taking readings, in order to prolong the life of your
batteries. By unloosening the little screw in the hub of the anemometer
vanes, you can remove them and also take off the brass
cap on the anemometer case. This should be taken apart once or
twice a month, and some machine oil used around the bearings
to keep them from wearing out too quickly.</p>

platinum wire electrodes fused in at the center, the whole
mounted in a metal socket on an adjustable support.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE BAROMETER</h3>

<p class='c009'>The barometer is used for measuring the pressure of the atmosphere.
The principle of this instrument was first discovered by
Torricelli, a pupil of Galileo, the great Italian philosopher and
scientist, in 1643. Many and various types of instruments have been
made, but the two most generally used, especially where accurate
indications are desired, are the mercurial and aneroid barometers.
Either of these instruments are quite sensitive to changes in the
weight or pressure of the earth’s atmosphere, and from their variations
we are able to draw conclusions relative to changes in the
weather. Figs. No. <a href='#fig41'>41</a> and <a href='#fig42'>42</a> illustrate the standard mercurial
and aneroid barometers used most extensively today. A description
of these barometers will serve to make the photographs clearer
to the readers of this text.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE MERCURIAL BAROMETER (Fig. <a href='#fig41'>41</a>)</h3>

<p class='c009'>The mercurial barometer in use today is practically the same
as that invented by Torricelli. Of course, many changes have
been made in the case containing the tube of mercury, adding to
its attractiveness, but the principle remains the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>The standard mercurial barometer consists of a straight glass
tube about thirty-two or thirty-three inches in length, hermetically
sealed at one end. The tube is of half-inch bore and is filled with
chemically pure mercury, which has been boiled in the tube to insure
the total exclusion of all air and moisture. After the tube has been
filled, the open end is immersed in a cistern of mercury. Upon
immersion the mercury drops in the tube to a height of 29.92
inches at sea level, or until counterbalanced by the weight of the
surrounding atmosphere pressing upon the surface of the mercury
in the cistern. The space in the top of the tube is a perfect vacuum
and is called the Torricellian vacuum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The glass mercury tube is enclosed in a brass case. About two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>inches from the top of the case is an opening extending down the
front and back for a distance of about eight inches. On each side
of this opening is a graduated scale, one side being in inches and the
other graduated in centimeters. The opening is fitted with a sliding
vernier scale graduated in millimeters, thus permitting the reading
of changes in the height of the mercury column most accurately,
as the sliding vernier may be adjusted to the level of the mercury
by means of a thumb screw fitted on the side of the case. The cistern
containing the mercury is of glass, with a soft leather or chamois
bottom and an adjusting screw, used to raise or lower the level
of the mercury, so that it just comes in contact with a small ivory
point, inserted in the top of the cistern, and which is used to mark
the zero of the scale. Observations of the changes in the atmospheric
pressure should be taken at regular intervals, and it is
necessary to adjust the height of the mercury in the cistern before
each observation. This is done by bringing the ivory point in
contact with the level of the mercury and then bringing the vernier
scale absolutely level with the top of the column of mercury in
the tube, and then take the reading.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mercurial barometer is a very delicate instrument and
when once placed in the desired position should not be moved.
Care should be taken that the room in which the barometer is placed
is of nearly uniform temperature, for if the temperature at the
top of the barometer is different than the temperature at the bottom,
of course there will be an effect produced on the changes in
the mercury column. All other barometers are set by the mercurial.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE ANEROID BAROMETER (Fig. <a href='#fig42'>42</a>).</h3>

<p class='c009'>The aneroid barometer is so constructed that it contains no
liquid whatever, and thus derives its name from the Greek compound
word “aneroid,” meaning “without fluid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The essential parts of the instrument are a metallic case from
which the air has been exhausted, and which contains a spring.
The case of elastic metal is fastened to a base plate at the bottom
and to the spring at the top. The pressure of the atmosphere
causes the case to expand and contract, thus affecting the spring,
which is connected to a needle or dial, causing the dial to move
around on the scale on the face of the instrument and record the
changes. The scale is marked off in inches from 28 to 31, and besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>a brass hand or pointer, used to designate the changes in the
atmospheric pressure, there is a small index hand to set over the
needle so that the amount of change in a certain period is easily
known on consulting the instrument.</p>

<div id='fig45'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus056.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='left'><i>Courtesy Julien Friez &amp; Sons, Baltimore, Md.</i></span><br /><br />Fig. 45</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The dial of the barometer is marked with the words “Fair,”
“Change,” and “Rain,” etc., but these words have no significance,
and should be disregarded. For instance, 29½ is marked “Change”;
30, “Fair”; 31, “Very dry”; 28½, “Rain.” If the barometer,
which has been standing at 30.9, suddenly drops down to 29.9, this
is positive indication that a storm is approaching, with strong
winds, yet, according to the dial on the aneroid, the reading
would be “Fair.” If the barometer were standing at 28 and rose
to 29, this would actually indicate approach of cold, dry weather,
and yet on the dial it reads “Rain.” This simply goes to show that
the readings on the dial are of no significance whatsoever, and are
not to be relied upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aneroid is not as accurate an instrument as the mercurial,
so should be checked up occasionally with the mercurial barometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aneroid type of barometer is also
used in altitude work, but must be compensated
before using.</p>

<p class='c007'>This type of barometer possesses
several advantages over the mercurial
in that it is portable and therefore used
for altitude work; at sea it is used
because there is no fluid to become unsettled
by the motion of the vessel; it
is used also in observatory work because
the action is quicker than the mercurial
barometer action, and sudden changes
likely to occur are indicated.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>INDICATIONS FROM THE BAROMETER</h3>

<p class='c009'>A single observation reading of the
barometer is of no significance. Readings
must be taken at different intervals
or the results will be misleading. The
important thing about the barometer is
to watch the rise and fall, particularly,
whether it is gradual or rapid. From
no single reading can you make an observation
or a forecast. A rapid rise
indicates that a strong wind is apt to
blow. A rapid fall indicates that the
weather will be unsettled, and that
strong winds are apt to blow. Both
indicate a change in the weather, depending
upon many things, particularly,
however, the direction from which the
wind blows. If an observer stands with the wind blowing on his
back, the area of low barometric pressure will be at his left, and
that of high barometric pressure at his right. With low pressure
in the west and high pressure in the east, the wind will be from
the south; but with low pressure in the east and high pressure in
the west, the wind will be from the north. The barometer rises
for northerly winds, from northwest by the north to eastward, for
dry, or less wet weather,
for less wind, or for more
than one of these changes—except
on a few occasions,
when rain, hail, or snow
comes from the northward
with strong wind. The
barometer falls for southerly
wind, from southeast,
by the south, to the westward,
for wet weather, for
stronger wind, or for more
than one of these changes,
except on a few occasions,
when moderate wind with
rain or snow comes from
the northward.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>GENERAL BAROMETER INDICATIONS</h3>

<p class='c009'>A gradual but steady rise
indicates settled fair
weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>A gradual but steady fall
indicates unsettled or wet
weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very slow rise from a
low point is usually
associated with high winds
and dry weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rapid rise indicates
clear weather with high
winds.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very slow fall from
a high point is usually connected
with wet and
unpleasant weather without
much wind.</p>

trifle, it indicates that there
is the tendency to rise or fall,
depending upon the direction
of movement of the hands.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Northeasterly winds precede
storms that approach from the
southwest; that is, in New
England and the Middle States

<h3 class='c008'>THERMOMETERS</h3>

<p class='c009'>For information regarding the
manufacture of thermometers,
we recommend P. R. Jameson’s
book, “Weather and Weather
Instruments,” published by the
Taylor Instrument Companies
of Rochester, N. Y.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thermometers are of great
importance to us in determining
weather.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>LOCATION OF THERMOMETERS</h3>

<p class='c009'>1. They must be properly
exposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. A good circulation of air
around them is necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. They must be properly
protected from the rays of the
sun.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span><i>Note</i>: If these instructions are not carefully followed out, errors
are apt to occur, and you will be misled.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a change of wind towards northerly directions, a thermometer
falls. For a change of wind toward
southerly directions a thermometer
rises.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THERMOMETERS</h3>

<p class='c009'>Maximum and minimum thermometers
are used to record the daily
maximum and minimum temperatures.
Fig. <a href='#fig46'>46</a> shows a typical maximum and
minimum thermometer used for giving
the extremes of temperature. One side
of the thermometer has a scale reading,
beginning at the top, from 60° below
zero to 140° above zero. This is the
scale used when determining the coldest
temperature reached during a day.
The other side of the thermometer has
a scale marked from 70° below zero,
beginning at the bottom and reading
up, to 130° above zero. On this side
the maximum heat reached during the
day is recorded. There is a small metal
piece in the tubes, one on each side,
and as the mercury pushes ahead or
recedes, the small index is left at the
lowest point reached in one tube and
at the highest point reached in the
other. The small metal piece is drawn
back to the level of the mercury by
means of a small magnet.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHEN MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE IS REACHED</h3>

<p class='c009'>You can generally look for maximum
temperature between three and
four o’clock in the afternoon. At this time the sun has reached
its highest altitude.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>WHEN THE MINIMUM TEMPERATURE IS REACHED</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This usually occurs a little while before sunrise. It is important
in weather observing to make a record of the highest temperature
of the day and the lowest temperature of the night. Continuous
observation, as the reader will appreciate, is practically impossible
for such a record.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE THERMOMETER FOR HUMIDITY IN THE AIR</h3>

<p class='c009'>Moisture or dampness in the air, as shown by an instrument
called the hygrometer, increases before rain, fog, or dew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before describing the hygrometer, a definition of a few of the
terms used in conjunction with the instrument will be found useful.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ABSOLUTE HUMIDITY</h3>

<p class='c009'>The amount of vapor actually present in the atmosphere is
termed the absolute humidity, expressed usually either in the
expansive force that the vapor exerts or in its weight in grains
per cubic foot of air.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>RELATIVE HUMIDITY</h3>

<p class='c009'>The absolute humidity divided by the amount of vapor that
might exist if the air were saturated gives a ratio that is called the
relative humidity.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>DEW POINT</h3>

<p class='c009'>The temperature at which moisture begins to be condensed on a
cold vessel or other container and becomes visible is called the dew
point.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>HOW HYGROMETERS ARE MADE</h3>

<p class='c009'>The most generally used hygrometer consists of two ordinary
thermometers, the bulb of one being covered with a piece of muslin
and kept constantly moistened with water by means of a wick or
cotton thread communicating with a container of water. The
difference in the readings of the two thermometers, the wet and the
dry, is observed, and knowing this, it is very easy to determine the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>humidity by consulting a table (see table on pages <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>–59), which
has been prepared for this purpose. These instruments are,
according to the increase in price, equipped with a table, and the
container is held in a wire frame, as you will see from the Figs. <a href='#fig49'>49</a>–<a href='#fig50'>50</a>
showing the standard Weather Bureau station instrument and the
Gilbert hygrometer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. <a href='#fig49'>49</a> shows the U. S. Standard Weather Bureau Station Rain
Gauge, Fig. <a href='#fig50'>50</a> the Gilbert Rain Gauge and Fig. <a href='#fig51'>51</a> the U. S.
Standard Weather Bureau Station Rain Gauge, Tipping Bucket
Type.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gilbert Weather Station is equipped with the Tipping
Bucket Type Rain Gauge. Fig. <a href='#fig51'>51</a> shows the apparatus clearly,
complete and mounted ready for use. The brass bucket seen in
position through the open door is adjusted to tip for each hundredth
inch of rainfall collected in the twelve-inch diameter receiver at
the top, and this rainfall is electrically recorded at any convenient
distance on a register. After any desired period the water may
be drawn off and check measurements made by means of the brass
measuring tube and graduated cedar stick shown in the figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The essential parts of the Gilbert Rain Gauge consists of a metal
tube twelve inches long, having a diameter of 1⁵⁄₁₆ inches (inside)
and a funnel-shaped top, the neck of which fits snugly into
the open end of the metal tube. The outside diameter of the neck
of the funnel is a trifle less than 1⁵⁄₁₆ inches. The area of the
circle formed at the top of the tube is one-tenth the area of the
funnel circle. A measuring stick is provided to measure the rainfall
collected in the tube.</p>

<p class='c007'>To determine the amount of rainfall on the surface of the ground,
the rain collected in the tube should be measured at regular intervals,
usually twelve hours apart. For every inch of rain collected
in the tube, as denoted by the measuring stick, it means that there
is one one-tenth<a id='t67'></a> of an inch of rain on the ground; if 10 inches
of rain in the tube, it signifies one inch of rain on the ground. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>other words, divide the figure recorded on the measuring stick
by ten<a id='t68'></a> for actual rainfall.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well to put some sort of a shelter around the gauge, so that
it will be protected from strong winds. The shelter is usually
placed at a distance from the tube equal to the height of the tube.
With the Gilbert rain gauge it is well to erect the shelter at a distance
of about three feet from the tube. It is essential that the
gauge be held in an upright position, so it should be fastened to
the roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Snow is measured by melting the quantity collected in the gauge
and follow the same procedure as in rainfall measurements.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another very common method, called ground measurement.
There are many instances where ground measurements are
inaccurate:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. When snow and rain are mixed or alternate.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. When melting accompanies snowfall.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. When snow is already upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. When the amount of fall is very small.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. When drifting is very bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. When the snow is blown about after the storm and before
measurements have been made.</p>

<p class='c007'>A bucket and a spring balance are used. The bucket is filled
with snow, but not packed down too hard, and weighed. The reading
of the index hand on the spring balance gives the density of
the snow. The depth of the snow in the vicinity of the spot from
which the bucket was filled is obtained and this figure is multiplied
by the density, thus giving the water equivalent of the snow
collected. For instance, if the reading of the balance was .16,
and the depth of the snow was 7 inches, multiply .16 by 7, and
the result, 1.12, is the water equivalent of the snow.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THERMOMETER SCALES</h3>

<p class='c009'>The first thermometer scale to give satisfaction was devised in
1714 by Fahrenheit. He determined the fixed points on the thermometer
in a very novel manner. Having been born at Dantzig,
he took for the zero point on his scale the lowest temperature
observed by him at Dantzig, which he found was that produced
by mixing equal quantities of snow and sal-ammoniac. The space
between this point and that to which the mercury rose at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>temperature of boiling water he divided into 212 parts. He
determined, with his thermometer, that the atmospheric pressure
governed the boiling point of water. Today the Fahrenheit thermometer
is used extensively, and has for its freezing point 32°
and for its boiling point 212°.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another scale that has not become too well known, because of
the fact that it did not meet with public favor, was devised by a
Frenchman, named Reaumur, in 1730, and bears his name. He
determined the freezing point of the scale at 0° and the boiling
point of water at 80°.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another Frenchman, named Anders Celsius, devised a scale
with the boiling point of water at 0° and the freezing point at 100°.
In 1743 a Frenchman, named Christin, living at Lyons, France,
reversed the points, and today the scale is known as the Centigrade
scale, and, together with the Fahrenheit scale, is used almost
exclusively wherever thermometers are required.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>HOW TO CHANGE ONE SCALE INTO ANOTHER</h3>

<p class='c009'>Centigrade degrees into Fahrenheit: multiply by 9, divide the
product by 5 and add 32.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fahrenheit degrees into Centigrade: subtract 32, multiply by 5,
and divide by 9.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reaumur degrees into Fahrenheit: multiply by 9, divide by 4,
and add 32.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fahrenheit degrees into Reaumur: subtract 32, multiply by 4,
and divide by 9.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reaumur degrees into Centigrade: multiply by 5 and divide
by 4.</p>

<p class='c007'>Centigrade degrees into Reaumur: multiply by 4 and divide
by 5.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will notice that on this map different lines are drawn: First,
the Isobar lines—these are solid lines drawn through places which
have the same barometric pressure. Second, the Isotherm lines—these
are dotted lines drawn through places having the same
temperature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Weather Bureau Maps are gotten out on the same day all
over the country, and the preparation of them is quite interesting.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 7:40 A. M. simultaneous readings are taken at all weather
bureau stations of the country. On the coast, where the time is
three hours different than at New York, the readings are taken
at 4:40, so that the hour corresponds at all places. At 8:00 A. M.
the various stations telephone their findings to the Western Union
Office located in their city and immediately the messages are transmitted
by Western Union to a central district office, or circuit
center as it is called. For New England, the circuit center is
Boston. All messages are received at this office, and from here
transmitted to the next office, which is New York, and from
New York to the next center, until the news is transmitted to the
coast. The wires are open from 8:00 until 9:30 A. M. The
western offices follow the same procedure until the weather indications
are received by all stations. Immediately the preparation
of the map is begun and they are mailed to interested parties by
the Weather Bureau Stations of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Figs. <a href='#fig52'>52</a>, <a href='#fig53'>53</a> and <a href='#fig54'>54</a> show three maps, typifying storms traveling
from the west to the east, and by studying them on successive days
you can at once grasp the importance of studying the weather from
these maps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. <a href='#fig53'>53</a> shows a storm of low pressure and how this area of low
pressure is progressing and moving from the west to the east.
Particular notice should be taken of how fast the storm travels,
that is, the distance it goes each day, and the direction it is going
and the results.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The arrows denote the direction of the wind, and you will notice
they point to the region of low barometric pressure. In the regions
of high barometric pressure the winds are in the opposite direction.
This readily explains to you why it is that you can expect changes
in weather conditions when the wind changes.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the markings and printed matter on each map, information
is secured regarding observations of the barometer, thermometer,
wind velocity, direction of the wind, kind of clouds, and their
movements, and the amount of precipitation (rain or snow), in
different localities.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>HOW THE STATE OF THE WEATHER IS INDICATED</h3>

<p class='c009'>Clear, partly cloudy, cloudy, rain or snow indications are symbolized.
The shaded area designates places or areas where precipitation
has occurred during the preceding twelve hours.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHAT THE WORDS “HIGH” OR “LOW” MEAN ON THE MAP</h3>

<p class='c009'>Low barometric pressure, or the storm centers, are indicated
on the map by the word “low.” High barometric pressure centers
are indicated by the word “high.” Note how they move in an
easterly direction; how they are progressive. They can be compared
to a series of waves, which we will call atmospheric waves.
The crest of the wave may be likened to the “highs” and the
troughs to the “lows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Usually the winds are southerly or easterly and therefore warmer
in advance of a “low.” When the “lows” progress east of a place,
the wind generally shifts to westerly and the temperature lowers.
The westward advance of the “lows” is preceded by precipitation,
and almost always in the form of rain or snow, following which
the weather is generally clear. Note how a “low” is followed by
a “high,” and so on as they move along eastwardly.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WHAT ISOTHERMS INDICATE</h3>

<p class='c009'>If the Isotherms run nearly parallel, that is, east and west,
there will most likely be no change in the temperature. Southerly
to east winds prevail west of the nearly north and south line,
passing through the middle of a “high” and also east of a like line
passing through the middle of a “low.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To the west of a nearly north and south line passing through
the middle of a “low,” northerly to westerly winds prevail. We
will find the same condition prevailing to the east of a line passing
through the center of a “high.”</p>

<div id='fig55'  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
<img src='images/illus077.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 55</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>When we find an absence of decidedly energetic “lows” and
“highs,” this is an indication of the continuance of existing weather.
We can expect this state of the atmosphere until later maps show
a beginning of a change, usually first appearing in the west.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>TRACKS OF STORMS IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<p class='c009'>The storms of the United States follow, however, year after year,
a series of tracks, not likely to change suddenly, and not irregular,
but related to each other by very well-defined laws.</p>

<p class='c007'>The United States Weather Bureau has made a very intensive
study of the positions of the tracks of the storms. Fig. <a href='#fig55'>55</a> shows
the mean tracks and the movement of storms from day to day.
This map indicates that generally there are two sets of lines running
west and east, one set over the northwestern boundary, the
Lake region, and the St. Lawrence Valley, the other set over the
middle Rocky Mountain districts and the Gulf States. Each of
these is double, with one for the “highs” and one for the “lows.”
Furthermore, there are lines crossing from the main tracks to join
them together, showing how storms pass from one to the other.
On the chart, the heavy lines all belong to the tracks of the “highs,”
and the lighter lines to the track of the “lows.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE MODE OF TRAVEL OF THE “HIGHS”</h3>

<p class='c009'>A “high” reaching the California coast may cross the mountains
near Salt Lake City (follow the track on the map), and then pass
directly over the belt of the Gulf States, turning northeastward
and reaching the Virginia coast; or it may move farther northward,
cross the Rocky Mountains in the State of Washington, up the
Columbia River Valley, then turn east, and finally reach the Gulf
of St. Lawrence. These tracks are located where they are by the
laws of general circulation of the atmosphere and the outline of
the North American continent. This movement of the “highs”
from the middle Pacific coast to Florida or to the Gulf of St. Lawrence
is confined to the summer half of the year, that is, from April
to September. In the winter months, on the other hand, the
source of the “highs” is different, though they reach the same
terminals.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>HISTORICAL FACTS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>THERMOMETERS</h3>

<p class='c009'>Galileo discovered the principles of the thermometer in 1592.
The Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand II, is given credit for
perfecting it in 1610. Athanasius Kircher is given credit for the
discovery of the mercurial thermometer. This was about 1641.
Ferdinand the II, in 1650 or thereabouts, filled a glass tube with
colored alcohol and hermetically sealed it after graduating the tube.
Fahrenheit is given credit for the discovery that water freezes
always at the same temperature. With these facts he devised a
scale for thermometers in 1714.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THERMOMETER RECORDS</h3>

<p class='c009'>A temperature of 111° below zero has been recorded at an altitude
of 48,700 feet in the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The highest record in the United States Weather Bureau was
taken in Death Valley, Cal., on June 30, July 1 and 2, 1891, when
the thermometer reached 122° F. Death Valley is also given credit
for the highest known monthly temperature, which was 102° F.
in the month of July. Arctic expeditions have records of 73°
and 66° below zero. This is the greatest natural cold recorded.
The average temperature in the United States is 52.4°; the average
temperature in England is 50°.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the interior of Australia a record has been taken of a drop of
60° to 70° in a few hours; whereas the most rapid change recorded
in the United States was 60° F. in twenty-four hours. This record
has been made twice, in 1880 and again in 1890.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lowest temperature recorded in the United States Weather
Bureau was at Poplar River, Mont., January, 1885, when the
thermometer registered 63° below zero.</p>

<p class='c007'>The estimated heat of the sun is 10,000°; the highest artificial
heat obtained is 7,000°. Regarding the heat of the sun, no definite
conclusions have been arrived at, so the above temperature is only
approximate.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>REGIONS OF LEAST RELATIVE HUMIDITY</h3>

<p class='c009'>Least relative humidity is found in places southwest of Arizona,
where the average is about 40°. Fifty degrees humidity means half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>as much moisture as is necessary for complete saturation. The
average in other parts of the country is from 60° to 80°.</p>

<p class='c007'>Steel boils at 3500°; water boils at 212°; liquid air submitted
to a degree of cold where it ceases to be a gas and becomes a solid
is 312° below zero. Professor John Dewar of England is credited
with some of the most remarkable experiments with low temperature,
and at these temperatures made some wonderful discoveries.
He went down so cold that he could freeze liquid air back into a
solid; he continued further until he reduced hydrogen, a very light
gas, to a liquid. This was at 440° below zero. One of the most
remarkable things he did was to freeze hydrogen into a solid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water boils at 183.2° Fahrenheit on top of Mt. Blanc; water
boils at 194° Fahrenheit on top of Mt. Quito.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>BAROMETERS</h3>

<p class='c009'>Torricelli is given credit for the discovery of the principles of
the barometer. Otto Von Guericke, of Magdeburg, to whom we
are indebted for the air pump, is credited as being the first person
to use the barometer as a weather indicator.</p>

<p class='c007'>Because of the fact that the mercurial barometer is not adaptable
for portability, many scientists began work on producing a
barometer without fluid that could be easily carried about and would
give accurate results. In 1798 M. Comte, professor of aerostatics
in the school at Meudon near Paris, invented the aneroid barometer,
which he used in his balloon ascents. This instrument has been
described fully on page <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>BAROMETER RECORDS</h3>

<p class='c009'>Lowest reading taken in the United States by the United States
Weather Bureau was 28.48, or practically three quarters of a
pound per square inch below normal. Altitude records have been
taken with the barometer as high as 85,270 feet. This record was
made at Uccle Observatory, Belgium, the pressure being 0.67°
at this point.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>HAIL</h3>

<p class='c009'>Hail varies from one-tenth inch to more than five inches in
diameter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is an extract from the “Memoirs of Benvenuto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Cellini” of a terrible hail storm in Lyons, France, in 1544: “The
hail at length rose to the size of lemons. At about half a mile’s
distance all the trees were broken down, and all the cattle were
deprived of life; we likewise found a great many shepherds killed,
and we saw hailstones which a man would have found it a difficult
matter to have grasped in both hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>New Hampshire has the record for the largest hailstones seen
here so far; they were 4 inches in diameter and weighed 18 ounces,
and were 12½ inches in circumferences.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>RAINFALL</h3>

<p class='c009'>There are records in Japan of where rain has reached 30 inches
in twenty-four hours; in India where it has reached 40 inches in
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average rainfall in the United States is 35 inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are certain places in India where the yearly rainfall averages
over 470 inches; whereas other regions of India show less
than 4 inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The higher the clouds are in the air, the larger the drops of rain
when they reach the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heaviest annual rainfall recorded any place in the world
is on the Khasi Hills in Bengal, where it registered 600 inches. The
major part of this was in half of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greatest amount of rainfall is in the northwestern part of
the United States; the least amount is in Arizona, the southwestern
part. In some parts of Egypt and Arabia, the only moisture that
is received there is in the form of dew.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average cloudiness of the earth has been estimated between
50 and 55 per cent. This amount slightly exceeds the cloud conditions
of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unalaska has a record of extreme cloudiness for one whole
month, February, 1880.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir J. C. Ross, an Arctic explorer, recorded a shower of nearly
an hour’s duration on Christmas day, 1839, without a cloud in
sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar record was made on June 30, 1877, at Vevay, Ind.,
where a shower lasted for five minutes in a cloudless sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fall of yellow snow was recorded at South Bethlehem, Pa.,
in 1889. Examination showed this coloration to be due to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>pollen of the pine trees which had been blown into the atmosphere
before the fall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another record of yellow rainfall was recorded at Lynchburg on
March 21, 1879.</p>

<p class='c007'>Golden snow was recorded at Peckoloh, Germany, in 1877.</p>

<p class='c007'>Green and red snows have been observed during Arctic explorations,
due to a minute organism that was in the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the temperature of the atmosphere is nearly 32° during a
snow storm and the wind is blowing, the flakes being damp and the
snowfall heavy, the flakes are apt to unite to form large masses of
snow in the atmosphere or air, which accounts for some of the
following records:</p>

<p class='c007'>At Chapston, Wales, in January, 1888, the snowflakes measured
3.6 inches in length and 1.4 inches in breadth, and 1.3 inches in
thickness. They amounted to 2½ cubic inches of water when
melted.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some remarkable instances of where hailstones have
cemented together, making large masses of ice. Some remarkable
records of this kind have been recorded in India.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Morganstown, Va., on April 28, 1877, hailstones 2 inches
long and 1½ inches in diameter fell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mean yearly pressure of the United States ranges between
30 and 30.1 inches when reduced by ordinary methods to sea level.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Unalaska, January 21, 1879, the barometer reading of 27.70
inches was recorded, and another low reading was made at Stykkisholm
of 27.91 inches on February 1, 1877. On September 27,
1880, a ship on the China Sea experienced a terrific typhoon, during
which the barometer went down in four hours from 29.64 to 27.04
inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greatest temperature ranges recorded are in the interior of
Siberia, where at Yakutsk they recorded a range of 181.4°.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most remarkable changes recorded within twenty-four hours
have been at Fort Maginnis, Mont., January 6, 1886, a fall of
56.40°; at Helena, Mont., January 6, 1886, a fall of 55° in sixteen
hours; at Florence, Ariz., June 26, 1881, 65° rise. On the northern
edge of the African desert the temperature of the air rose to
127.4°.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lowest single temperature in the world was recorded at
Werchojansk, Siberia, in January, 1885, when it was 90.4° below
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>zero, while the average temperature for the month at the same
place was 63.9° below zero.</p>

<p class='c007'>Highest mean rainfall occurs in Sumatra, averaging about
130 inches; the rainfall of 493.2 inches per year occurs at Cherapunji,
Assam, India, which is the largest in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lowest rainfall in the world occurs at Southeast California,
West Arizona, and the valley of lower Colorado, where the rainfall
averages less than 3 inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most remarkable rainfall recorded in the United States for
twenty-four hours occurred at Alexandria, La., June 15, 1886,
when the rainfall reached the enormous amount of 21.4 inches. The
most remarkable rainfall recorded in the world occurred at Purneah,
Bengal, September 13, 1879, when the rainfall reached the unprecedented
amount of 35 inches in twenty-four hours.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>CLOUDBURSTS</h3>

<p class='c009'>On August 17, 1876, at Fort Sully, Dakota, occurred one of the
heaviest cloudbursts ever known. The water moved out of the
canyon on the opposite side of the Missouri in a solid bank three
feet deep and 200 feet wide. There are many other remarkable
cloudbursts recorded doing great injury, drowning and killing
many people.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WIND VELOCITY</h3>

<p class='c009'>Among the most remarkable wind velocity records is that of
Cape Lookout on October 17, 1879, when the wind blew at a rate
of 138 miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the worst cyclones ever recorded in North America was
the flood, as it is usually termed, at Galveston, Tex. This storm
began on the 1st day of September, 1900, and lasted until the 12th.
It reached its maximum destructive force on the 8th. Six thousand
lives were lost and $30,000,000 worth of property was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even worse than any of these was the one at Calcutta in 1864,
followed by a storm wave over 16 feet high, causing a death-rate
of 45,000 persons.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>BLIZZARDS</h3>

<p class='c009'>The blizzard in Dakota of 1873 is one of the worst on record,
but probably the most disastrous in the United States occurred in
Montana, Dakota, and Texas on January 11, 1888. The loss of

  <h3 class='c008'>TORNADOES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The United States is more liable to tornadoes than any other
part of the globe. In the United States over 3,000 people have
been killed by tornadoes and thousands more have been injured.
The greatest loss of lives recorded by tornadoes was at Adams
City, Miss., on June 16, 1842, when 500 lives were lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most remarkable hail storm was that of July 13, 1788,
through France to Belgium, and did a property damage of over five
million dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>There have been many destructive hailstorms in the United
States. One on July 6, 1878, at central New York extended into
parts of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Stones
fell recorded to measure 7 inches in diameter.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ROTARY MOTIONS OF STORMS</h3>

<p class='c009'>Benjamin Franklin has been given credit for the discovery that
storms have a rotary motion, and that they move from west to east.
This discovery was made in 1747.</p>

<p class='c007'>Franklin did not positively prove these facts, and it remained
for Redfield, Espy, Maury, Abbe to substantiate the truth of this
statement.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE FIRST UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU</h3>

<p class='c009'>The first United States Weather Bureau was established in 1870.
General Albert J. Myer was the first chief of the United States
Weather Bureau.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is estimated that we are 250,000 miles from the moon.</p>

<p class='c007'>At high altitudes, the cover of a kettle must be weighted down
in order to boil an egg hard. This is to enable the pressure of steam
to allow temperature high enough for boiling. In other words, it
would be impossible to boil an egg in an open vessel at a high
altitude.</p>
